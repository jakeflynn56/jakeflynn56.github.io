                In Spring 2022, I presented my research, "Effect of Platelet Storage Temperature on Platelet Aggregation and Contractile Force Production", at the

            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>
                Platelet transfusions are used to treat patients with acute hemorrhage, low platelet count, and dysfunctioning platelets, but the ideal storage conditions
                 for platelets prior to transfusion is poorly understood. Storage at room temperature is the current gold standard for platelets, but there is a limited
                 shelf life of 5-7 days due to storage lesions and risk of bacterial growth. As a result, there is a need for alternative approaches that can increase the
                 shelf life of platelets and increase their availability in remote locations or during major catastrophes. Here, we examined whether cold storage of
                 platelets, e.g. 4ยบ C, which can extend their shelf life to 14 days, has an impact on their hemostatic function. Specifically, the function of cold-stored
                 and room temperature-stored platelets were investigated by utilizing a microfluidic shear assay that measures platelet aggregation and contractile force
                 during the formation of a thrombus. Blood was perfused through the microfluidic channels, and platelet aggregation and production of contractile forces
                 were calculated using custom MATLAB code. The previous code required user input at several steps to complete the analysis, so improved code was written
                 and tested that quantified area and force with significantly less user input. Results from experiments and subsequent analysis found that cold-stored
                 platelets formed larger aggregates and similar contractile forces as room temperature-stored platelets, indicating that their hemostatic function was not
                 impaired. This investigation highlights the need for further investigations on cold-stored platelets as a means to increase shelf life and availability for
                 transfusions.
